				"One of the most complicated allomantic abilities it allows the art of burning steel to push metals away in a straight line from the user's center of gravity there are 2 general rules for steelpushing, which also apply to ironpulling, its paired opposite. The first rule is that the strength of your push is roughly proportional to your physical weight. This means that larger Allomancers can generally steelpush and ironpull more powerfully than a smaller counterpart. While proportional, the force exerted by a steelpush is much greater than the Coinshot's weight, allowing them to push themselves into the air by pushing on a piece of metal that is on the ground (or is anchored to something that weighs more than they do). The second rule is that metal that is at least partially inside a person's body cannot be affected by steel. Both of these rules can be overcome by a sufficiently strong Coinshot, however.",
