Aluminum in a wound will make it impossible for the Thug to heal the injury around the metal for as long as it remains in the body. Pewter also enhances the body's natural balance, granting almost unnaturally smooth movements. It also increases reaction speed and gives them resistance to hot and cold temperatures. Finally, it increases endurance, letting the body continue on long past when it would have normally shut down. Pewter can be dangerous when it runs out, which is a serious concern since it is the fastest-burning of the eight basic metals. A Thug having just survived a deadly wound can die from the resulting effects when the body runs out of pewter to burn. However, the body will naturally burn pewter in an attempt to heal itself, so even an unconscious Thug can be given additional pewter to survive otherwise life-threatening situations.",
